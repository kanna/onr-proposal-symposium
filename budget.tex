\section{Budget request}

We estimate at \$2500 per person the cost of this event. The costs
include all expenses to come to the symposium from within Europe and the
United States. As noted, we believe to get the most out of the
participants, who have substantial expertise and in most cases at the
peak of their careers, covering these modest expenses will be in the
interests of the symposium. In addition, in the light of the pandemic,
we believe having this event in-person will make the efforts worthwhile.

The overall budget for the \symp is as below in Table
\ref{tab:budget}.

Potential sponsors include:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]

  \item US Office of Naval Research (ONR) and ONR Global
  \item Research Council Norway (RCN)
  \item Regional Government of Azores
  % \item Portuguese Government
  % \item Portuguese Foundation of Science and Technology (FCT)
  \item Schmidt Ocean Institute (SOI)
  \item European Union networking funding (EU)
  \item Belgian Science Policy Office
  \item US National Science Foundation (NSF)

\end{itemize}

\noindent
At this time, we have the support of RCN for a total of US \$10,000
and are negotiating the release of US \$30,000 from ONR, US \$5,000
from the Ocean Foundation, \euro 3,500 from the Belgian Science
Policy office, \euro 15,000 from the Regional Govt. of Azores and US
\$15,000 from NSF, the latter targeted only towards US participants.

Our expectation is that the \air will play host to the symposium. In
doing so their role will be to receive the funds from various sources
and provide reimbursement for expenses for the participants and as a
result will also be considered as a 'sponsor' of the \sympe.
