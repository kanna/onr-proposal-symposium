\section{Budget request}

We estimate at \$2500 per person the cost of this event. The costs
include all expenses to come to the symposium from within Europe and the
United States. As noted, we believe to get the most out of the
participants, who have substantial expertise and in most cases at the
peak of their careers, covering these modest expenses will be in the
interests of the symposium. In addition, in the light of the pandemic,
we believe having this event in-person will make the efforts worthwhile.
