\section{Naval Relevance}

The capacity to observe the actual conditions that affect the water
column over the coastal ocean regions of interest in such a way that
these observations can effectively feed the operational models with
assimilation, play a critical role for understanding our coastal
ocean. In addition, the operational Navy has embarked on an ambitious
effort to bring autonomous platforms into the mix for a range of
capabilities. Combining physical and biological observations with such
autonomous platforms in the aerial, surface and underwater domains,
brings together such advances and directly impacts the warfighter. Our
symposium will focus on the interdisciplinary aspects of such methods,
which will directly advance the operational effectiveness of the
warfighter while better understanding the coastal and open ocean upper
water-column.
