\section{Location}

The event will take place on Terceira island in the Azores, from
\textbf{4\textsuperscript{th} to 7\textsuperscript{th} July
  2022}. Given the intent of the symposium, with the necessity of
having extensive networking time among participants, the event is
slated to be in-person. In addition, and because of small group size,
organizing all daily activities centered on one location (in addition
to the talks and discussions) will benefit further networking. The
event location is critical since our symposium brings together
scientists and technologists primarily from the US and Europe. The
Azores offers a central and accessible region and will remind and
inspire the participants of the proximity of the ocean and the focus
of the meeting.

\noindent
The proposed program is as shown in Table \ref{tab:symp}. A detailed
program will be confirmed by March 2022.
