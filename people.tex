\section{Participants and their selection}

We are aiming at a maximum of 30 attendees to ensure an active
participation of all attendees. The overall gender and nationality
balance is shown in Fig. \ref{fig:country}. The list of invited
participants all of whom have accepted is below in Table
\ref{tab:part}. The list does not include the 3 ESR's expected to be
selected early 2022.
