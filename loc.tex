\section{Location}

The event will take place at Terceira island in the Azores, from 4th to
7th July 2022. Given the format of the symposium, with the necessity of
having extensive networking time among participants, the format needs to
be in person. In addition, and because this will be a relatively small
group, organizing all daily activities together (in addition to the
talks and discussions) will benefit further networking in more relaxed
situations. The location is critical since our symposium brings together
scientists and technologists primarily from the US and Europe. The
Azores offers a central and accessible region and will remind and
inspire the participants of the proximity of the ocean and the focus of
the meeting.

The proposed program is as below in Table \ref{tab:symp}:
