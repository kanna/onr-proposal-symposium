\subsection{Recent meetings}

Given the broadly inter-disciplinary nature of this meeting, the overall
\emph{approach to how} it will be carried out, this meeting is
unique. However, the genesis of the format was formulated by Rajan and
others in 2000 at the \nas Planning/Scheduling Workshop (now called
IWPSS). A version of the speaker/challenger was then attempted with
moderate results for the first time in 2013 (Rajan co-chair) in Las
Palmas, Gran Canaria in the ocean science/engineering
domain. Subsequently Eidsvik and Rajan co-organized an ONR funded
``Symposium on Oceanographic Data Analytics'' in Trondheim, Norway in
2018, when Rajan was affiliated with
NTNU\footnote{\url{https://wiki.math.ntnu.no/ocean-analytics/prog}}. This
last meeting was formulated in a traditional manner, in large part
because it was challenging to get a critical mass of participants to
travel to that country. While inter-disciplinary in nature, no
speaker/challenger modus operandi was designed for it, even if there was
sufficient dialog between participants. The 3-day meeting was also not
shaped around networking or a specific outcome for collaborations across
disciplines or boundaries.

Further, it is to be noted, that other than those above, no
workshop/symposia have been conducted in a context that binds together
science and marine technology specifically for ocean observation, to
our knowledge.
