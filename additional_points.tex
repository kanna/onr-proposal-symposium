\subsection{Topics Discussed}

We will be holding a multi-disciplinary discussion bringing together novel ways at observing the world’s upper-ocean bio-geochemical and dynamics processes. The symposium gathers experts in very different branches of oceanography (physical & biology, satellite and in situ, robotics, etc) to ensure we have this broad and multi-disciplinary aspect. \\


A preliminary agenda can be found in Annex I


\subsection{Leading questions}

The leading question is how can we \textbf{advance our understanding of the ocean upper bio-geochemical and dynamics processes} by using the latest developments in science and technology. The implications of this question are far-reaching since ocean health -and its inhabitants'- as well as the well being of society in general depend on our capacity to observe, monitor and forecast the bio-geochemical and dynamics processes in the upper ocean.\\


\subsection{Facilitation of the discussion}

We (Jo, Kanna and Aida, the three organizers) have long-time experience organizing and facilitating scientific meetings. We know the topics that will be presented and can interact actively with the speakers on all these. We therefore believe we are in the best position to facilitate the discussion and bring it to a meaningful conclusion. In the event that an external facilitator would be deemed necessary, and given the length of the symposium (4 days, 9AM-6PM), it would be necessary to count on at least two external facilitators, otherwise it would be too exhausting for just one person and this person would under-perform.\\

We will have a visual facilitator (Marsha Dunn \url{https://www.marshadunn.com/} during the whole duration of the event. This kind of facilitation is very efficient at helping to start discussion around certain topics, reflect in real time where the discussions should lead us and make connections on our reflections that the participants didn't think of before. \\

 

\subsection{Note taking}
Note-taking will be taken care of by all three of us, and also by the three Early Researchers that will participate to this symposium. In addition, all participants will be asked to use \url{www.slido.com} for recording their questions and organize the discussions. Slido allows everyone to post questions and vote others' questions, so that we can see in real time which questions attract more attention and should be addressed first.\\
 

 

\subsection{Synthesizing the attendees’ input}
This will be also done through slido, which allows to respond to questions from speakers also in delayed mode. We will ask speakers to answer the questions directed to them so we can use this as material to synthesize the discussions of the meeting. The visuals produced by Marsha Dunn will also serve as a very efficient summary of the symposium.\\

 

\subsection{Deliverable report}
After the meeting, all authors, led by Jo, Kanna and Aida, will write a "perspective" paper to be published in a high-profile journal (Science, Nature or Oceanography).\\
