\section{Introduction}

We propose to hold a symposium that will bring together a small group of
experts in several areas of ocean observation. Instead of holding a
“classical” conference, we aim at a very dynamic and participative
format in which each attendee presents their ideas and seeks maximum
interaction with the other experts. To enhance these discussions, each
presenter will be paired with another attendee from a different field,
who would be expected to reach into the speaker’s ideas, shared a priori
to provide public feedback during the event. The expected outcome is the
generation of new ideas and advancements in the interdisciplinary
observation of the ocean, as well as new collaborations between these
disciplines. Ocean observation includes data from satellites, in situ
platforms, numerical ocean models and AI-based robotic vehicles. A wise
combination of these elements can help in reaching technological
advances and robustness in understanding the complexity of the
ocean. New technology must always be accompanied by a deep understanding
of the dynamical nature of the ocean in order. Some parts of the ocean
are still severely under-sampled and filling these gaps is required to
progress scientific understanding.
