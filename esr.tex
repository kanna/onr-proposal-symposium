\paragraph{ESR selection process} ESR's will be selected by the
organizers of this symposium in a process similar to that that led to
the selection of the participants itself. Applicants interests and
capabilities will be matched with the goals of the symposium; those
screened will be shortlisted and evaluated by the organizers. The top
three candidates based on the technical and scientific needs of the
symposium and its coverage of the field, will be invited to
participate. ESR will not give talks, but will be required to present
their academic work at the poster session planned for the event.

\paragraph{ESR selection criteria} Candidate ESR's will be asked to
provide the following information to gauge their interest in participation:

\begin{enumerate}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]

\item Currently enrolled (2021-22 academic year) in a Phd program in
  an accredited academic institution in a SIDS (Small Island
  Developing States)\footnote{\url{https://www.un.org/ohrlls/content/list-sids}} or LDC (Least Developed Countries including Land-Locked
   Developing Countries)\footnote{\url{https://www.un.org/development/desa/dpad/least-developed-country-category/ldcs-at-a-glance.html}}
\item Engaged in inter-disciplinary research across the ocean sciences
  and marine technology focused on upper water-column ocean processes
  and dynamics 
\item Provide a CV and a letter of recommendation from her/his primary
  advisor demonstrating research accomplishment in any of the fields
  above 
\item Provide a 1 page (only) statement of interest and how attendance
  at this event would help their research  
\item Present at least 1 poster of their research
\item Be articulate, energetic and be able to communicate clearly and
  succinctly to the distinguished scholars at the event 
\end{enumerate}  

\noindent
Additionally preference will be given to:

\begin{itemize}[noitemsep,topsep=0pt,parsep=0pt,partopsep=0pt]
\item women and minorities
\item a first author publication in a peer-reviewed journal recognized
  in any of the above fields would be a plus 
\end{itemize}

\noindent
As part of the acceptance, the ESR would need to work with the symposium
organizers and help with the logistics of the symposium, prior, during
and after the event. % \nsfe's support will cover the following costs for
% each of these three ESRs, to/from flights from the candidates home
% country with an economy class ticket and boarding and lodging costs at
% the symposium venue.

\paragraph{Dissemination of the call for ESRs} To reach out to select
these candidates, the organizers will send out a call to a number of
mailing lists in robotics and AI, the European Marine
Board~\footnote{\url{https://www.marineboard.eu/}} and
ASLO~\footnote{\url{https://www.aslo.org/}} which have extensive
outreach worldwide to the ocean science and technology communities
that we intend to recruit. In addition, since the symposium has been
officially endorsed by the UN Decade office, members of the planning
committee (M. Linen, C. McLean from the US and Atmanand from India all
known to the organizers) will be recruited to further advertise this
event worldwide. % Finally, the President of the US National Academies
% and prominent academic Marcia
% McNutt~\footnote{\url{http://www.nasonline.org/member-directory/members/52683.html}}
% will be asked to spread the word from NAS's sources, also
% worldwide. Finally the \air we will disseminate the call for ESRs
% among their member countries' institutional representatives.
