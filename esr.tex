\paragraph{ESR selection process} ESR's have been selected by the
organizers of this symposium in a process similar to that that led to
the selection of the participants itself. Applicants interests and
capabilities were matched with the goals of the symposium; those
screened were shortlisted and evaluated by the organizers. The top
three candidates based on the technical and scientific needs of the
symposium and its coverage of the field, were invited to
participate. ESR's will not give talks, but will be required to
present their academic work at the poster session planned for the
event.  As part of the acceptance, the ESR would need to work with the
symposium organizers and help with the logistics of the symposium,
prior, during and after the event.

\paragraph{ESR selections} As of March 2022, the following ESR's have
been selected from a pool of 10 candidates from across the world. They
are:
