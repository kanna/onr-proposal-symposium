\section*{Executive Summary}

We propose to hold a symposium on 'Advances in Ocean Observation' to
generate ideas across ocean science and technology with a central focus
on inter-disciplinary efforts to pull in computational and robotic
intelligence.  In the process, we hope to make connections for ideation
to advance observation methods at various levels (national,
international) and engage and encourage practical inter-disciplinary
efforts which advance science and problem solving methods with real
societal impact. For ideation to succeed, we believe in bringing
together a small group of prominent scientists and technologists from
the US and Europe and engage one another in an immersive environment.
